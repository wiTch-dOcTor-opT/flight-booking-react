# Flight Booking System

This project was bootstrapped and created [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for Altimetrik.

## Project Info

This is a small emo of the flight booking system.
Here we have a search bar with items like source, destination, travel date and return date.

When you want to search any info you can click search and it will display the flights available at that date in a table.
If you want to see return flight for the date, it wil show return flights between you routes in a different table below.

## How to run the project

In the project directory, you can do:

### `npm install`

It will install all the dependencies for the project.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
